Add your dialogue files here. Note that the full contents of this /dialogues/
folder is ignored by git, except for the specific "test" files that come with
the source code:

 - en/basic.wool
 - nl/basic.json

These files are specifically excluded from the ignore rule in the git ignore
file located here:

 /wool/java/WoolWebService/.gitignore

If you want to include additional "test" dialogues with the source code, don't
forget to include them in this .gitignore file.

This is a test of conditional statements.

First, we test numeric and string comparisons.

<br>

<<if "3" == 3>>
"3" == 3 is true
<<else>>
"3" == 3 is false
<<endif>>

<br>

<<if "03" == 3>>
"03" == 3 is true
<<else>>
"03" == 3 is false
<<endif>>

<br>

<<if "2.50" == 2.5>>
"2.50" == 2.5 is true
<<else>>
"2.50" == 2.5 is false
<<endif>>

<br>

<<if "0" == 0>>
"0" == 0 is true
<<else>>
"0" == 0 is false
<<endif>>

In this file, we test different comparisons inside IF statements.

Here we test comparison ops.

<br>

<<if "12" > 3>>
"12" > 3 is true
<<else>>
"12" > 3 is false
<<endif>>

<br>

<<if 3 < 12>>
3 < 12 is true
<<else>>
3 < 12 is false
<<endif>>

<br>

<<if "3" <= 12>>
"3" <= 12 is true
<<else>>
"3" <= 12 is false
<<endif>>

<br>

<<if "3" >= "12">>
"3" >= "12" is true
<<else>>
"3" >= "12" is false
<<endif>>

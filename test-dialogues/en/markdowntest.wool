The Wool standard includes basic markdown support. Check the Basic section of [this cheatsheet](https:\//www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). You have to set the format to "markdown" (bottom left menu).

The Wool editor currently uses marked.js to format markdown, which can handle more than the basic markdown.

Which markdown features do you want to test?
